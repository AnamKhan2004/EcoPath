# EcoPath
## Inspiration
As climate change concerns grow, individuals and organizations are increasingly aware of their carbon footprints. 
However, many lack easy access to information about the environmental impact of their travel choices.
Just enter the start and end points of travel and our app will display the carbon for many forms of transportation!
## What it does
- Integrates an interactive map for easy navigation and better user experience.
- Allows input of start and end points, such as destination addresses.
- Uses Google Maps API to find the fastest route to your destination going through multiple routes for various modes of transportation.
- Uses average values of fuel type, efficiency, and carbon emissions per fuel burned to calculate emissions for various modes of transportation.
## Benefits
- Environmental Impact: Making more eco-friendly travel choices helps users reduce their carbon footprints.
- Raises awareness about the environmental impact of different travel modes.
- Convenience: Provides a one-stop solution for comparing travel emissions, making it easier for users to plan their journeys.
## What's next for EcoPath
- Display routes on the interactive map
- live tracking and updating of their carbon emissions based on how much they have travelled so far
- Add additional transportation options, such as electric vehicles
- Include a more accurate carbon calculator (maybe using an API for the calculations as well)
- Adding Motivational perks such as rewards or points, etc.
